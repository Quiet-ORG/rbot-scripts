#### Methods
`void StackGlitch(string item)` - **This is patched**. This used to perform the bank stack glitch to bypass standard stack sizes.

`void AddTempItem(string name, int num = 100)` - **This has been patched**. This used to give the player as much of the specified temporary item as they wanted.

`void JoinGlitched(string map)` - **This has been patched**. This used to join a glitched room with higher spawn rates and faster HoTs/DoTs. This have been replaced to just join a map.
