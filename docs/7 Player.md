### Methods
`void Pickup(params string[] items)` - Picks up the specified items.

`void PickupFast(params string[] items)` - Picks up the specified items without waiting for them to be picked up (equivalent to `Pickup` without `SafeTimings`).

`void RejectExcept(params string[] items)` - Rejects all drops except for the given ones.

`bool DropExists(string name)` - Checks whether the specified drop exists.

`void PickupAll()` - Picks up all available drops.

`void RejectAll()` - Rejects all available drops.

`void WalkTo(float x, float y)` - Walks to the specified point.

`void SetSpawnPoint()` - Sets the player's spawn point to the current cell.

`void LoadBank()` - Loads the player's bank.

`void CancelTarget()` - Untargets the currently targeted player/monster.

`void ApproachTarget()` - Approaches the currently selected target.

`void Attack(string name)` - Attacks the monster with the specified name.

`void Attack(Monster monster)` - Attacks the specified monster instance.

`void Kill(string name)` - Attacks the specified monster until it is dead.

`void Kill(Monster monster)` - Attacks the specified monster instance until it is dead.

`void Hunt(string name)` - Searches the current room for a monster with the given name and jumps to that monster's cell to kill it. To specify multiple monster names, separate them in `name` with a `'|'` character.

`void HuntForItem(string name, string item, int quantity, bool tempItem = false, bool rejectElse = true)` - Hunts the specified monster(s) until the specified quantity of an item is obtained.

`void HuntForItem(string[] names, string item, int quantity, bool tempItem = false, bool rejectElse = true)` - Overload for `HuntForItem` where an array of names can be passed. This is equivalent to separating monster names with a `'|'`.

`void HuntForItem(List<string> names, string item, int quantity, bool tempItem = false, bool rejectElse = true)` - Another overload for `HuntForItem` where a list of monster names can be passed.

`void HuntForItems(string name, string[] items, int[] quantities, bool tempItems = false, bool rejectElse = true)` - Hunts the specified monster(s) until the specified quantities of items are obtained. The same overloads that exist for `HuntForItem` exist for this method.

`void AttackPlayer(string name)` - Attacks the specified player.

`void KillPlayer(string name)` - Attacks the specified player until they are dead.

`void UseSkill(int index)` - Uses the skill at the given index.

`void Jump(string cell, string pad)` - Jumps to the specified cell and pad.

`void Join(string map, string cell = "Enter", string pad = "Spawn")` - Joins the map and jumps to the specified cell and pad (you need not specify the cell and pad as they have default values). This method will keep attempting to join the specified map with a 2.5 second delay until it succeeds.

`void Goto(string name)` - Goes to the specified player.

`void EquipItem(string item)` - Equips the item with the given name.

`void EquipItem(int id)` - Equips the item with the specified id.

`void OpenBank()` - Opens the player's bank.

`void Rest(bool full = false)` - Rests the player. If `full` is true, the bot will wait until the player's health and mana are full.

`bool IsBoostActive(Item.BoostTypes boost)` - Checks if the specified boost is active.

`void UseBoost(int id)` - Uses the boost with the given id.

#### Examples
The main use of `ScriptInterface#Player` is movement and combat. This is especially useful in fulfilling quest requirements. Examples can be found at the end of the documentation.
